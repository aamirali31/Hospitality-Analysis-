# Hospitality-Analysis-
In this project I optimise revenue management for a hotel. With the help of SQL server to import data and perform quantitative analysis. By joining tables and executing quaries.
In this project, I solved three critical questions:

Firstly, analyzing the data revealed that the hotel's revenue was increasing by year. This allowed the hotel management to track thier progress and set revenue goals for the upcoming years.

Secondly, I analyzed the data related to parking lot size and its impact on the revenue. After analysis data revealed that the hotel's current parking size is adequate, and increasing it would not lead to significant increase in revenue. This insights helped the hotel management avoid a potential unnecessary investment.

Lastly, I analyzed the data to identify trends. With the help of data visualization techniques such as trendline, I was  able to identify key trend and the pattern in the hotel's revenue. This provided the hotel management with the insights to adjust their revenue management stategy and make more informed business decisions.
